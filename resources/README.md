# APPLICATION_NAME

Write a short summary here (ie. one or two lines) which could be read
almost as a slogan or sub-header.

Show badges whenever applicable and possible, such as the those issued
by [Travis CI][1] (ie. ![Travis CI: Passing][2]).

## Overview

Write a [captivating, informative, and brief summary][3] of what your
application attempts to achieve or offer.

## Getting Started

A good "Getting Started" should include as much information as possible
to assist a developer in getting this project up and running on their
system. This should include things such as:

- Instructions on installing any software dependencies

- Instructions on running the app. For example, with a Rails project
  you should include the necessary `rake` commends, such as
  `rake db:create`, `rake db:migrate`, and `rake db:seed` process here,
  as well as instructions on starting a server

- Usernames and passwords, etc.

- Information about database seeds, environment-specific settings

- Instructions for any Git-ignored files (such as `.yml` files)

When writing instructions pretend you’re writing them for someone who
knows next to nothing about developing in the framework/language your
application uses.

## Requirements

List all used technologies, frameworks, etc.

## Usage

Before generating this application, you will need:

- Ruby >= 2.0.0

- Rails 4.0.x

## Testing

All you need to include in the “Testing” section is the commands to run
any of the test suites you have (e.g.: RSpec, Jasmine, Cucumber,
Spinach) and any setup you need to do before-hand (e.g.: rake
db:test:prepare). This section will be small but vital.

## Deployment

Information you might want to include is:

Which server is the application on? Is it on Amazon Sydney? A server in
the office? A data-centre down the road?
How can a developer connect to the server? Do they need particular
permissions? Who do they need to talk to to get those permissions?
Where on the server is the application located
What is the deploy process for this server
Are there any other services on the box related to the app a developer
will need to know about? Any cron jobs? Some Resque workers?

## About

Insert information about and links to the relevant software authors
here.

List any online tools related to project (tracker, wiki, etc).
